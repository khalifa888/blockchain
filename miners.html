   > What is Mai Anguwa Chain?
   <br><br>

   MCC is the native token in Mai Anguwa Chain.<br>
   Mai Anguwa Chain is based on POV consensus algorithm.
   </p>
   <p>
   > How it works?
   <br><br>
   User tries to carry out transaction, miner validates the transaction and add it to the chain, the recipient wallet receives the value.
   </p>
   <p>
   > What is mining?
   <br><br>
   Mining is the process used to secure, verify transactions  and add MCC coin transaction data to the Mai Anguwa's global public ledger and create new MCC coins by solving extremely complicated math problems. When a MCC Coin is successfully mined, the miner receives a predetermined amount of MCC.
   </p>

   <p>
  > Who is miner?
   <br><br>
   People who are involved in the process of mining are known as miners. Miners help keep the chain active to carry out transaction making the chain miners-driven.
